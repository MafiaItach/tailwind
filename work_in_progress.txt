THIS IS ANOTHER PART OF MY CODE 
THIS PART i save the playlist by there id and fletch the song in revealSongs function by using page token to fetch all..... the song ,this use so much api call, i want to change this 

not only saving the playlist id , but also fetch the playlist song (using page token) and save the song id and title in local storage for the first time under key name (savedPlaylists) and the value are in this format for example dd is playlist name and "xz9RiSO51Kq3 "this is the playlist id 

DD(xz9RiSO51Kq3): [{id: "Kq3GX0BFGJg",title:"Main Agar Kahoon (Lyrics)..."},{.....}] 
0:{id: "Kq3GX0BFGJg",Main Agar Kahoon (Lyrics)...}
id: "Kq3GX0BFGJg"
title: "Main Agar Kahoon (Lyrics)" 
1: {id: "RO51nJRiSgQ", title: "Main Agar Kahoon "} 
id: "RO51nJRiSgQ"
title: "Main Agar Kahoon | Om Shanti Om " 
2: {id: "nWxz9BdtTPs",…}
id: "nWxz9BdtTPs"
title: "Tum Se Hi (Unplugged) Lyrical Video: Shahid Kapoor" 

in revealSongs function get the id and title from localstorage and show them(don't need to make api call here )

now load the 1st song thumbnail as a playlist thumbnail show the song in songlistcontainer after clicking the  playlist thumbnail load song thumbnail use the previous (file your-playlist.js) class and id name make changes to function addPlaylist , revealSongs displaySavedPlaylists





this is my login.js file , in this file i load youtube account playlist , and save them to key savedPlaylists , change the getPlaylists function to follow the same structure to value , and save the song id and title 

this is the structure
{
    "My Playlist (PL12345)": [
        { "id": "abc123", "title": "Song A" },
        { "id": "def456", "title": "Song B" }
    ],
    "Another Playlist (PL67890)": [
        { "id": "ghi789", "title": "Song C" },
        { "id": "jkl012", "title": "Song D" }
    ]
}

this is the file (login.js)
